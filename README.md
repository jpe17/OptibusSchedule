### Scheduling System for Buses and Drivers: README

---

## Overview
This scheduling system provides an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) solution to handle the scheduling of buses and drivers. It allows for the management of duties, events, vehicles, and various scheduling rules.

---

## Modules Overview

### 1. Break Rules
Break rules determine when and how drivers can take breaks during their shifts. There are multiple types of break rules, each of which is implemented in its own module.

- **break_rule.py**: Contains the abstract base class for break rules.
- **continuous_fixed_rule.py**: Implements a continuous break rule.
- **fixed_break_rule.py**: Implements a fixed break rule.

### 2. Duty Type
Duties are assignments given to drivers, such as routes to drive or breaks. The duty type determines the kind and constraints of a particular duty.

- **duty_type.py**: Contains the representation of a duty type.

### 3. Event
Events are activities with a start and end time, and possibly an origin and destination. These can be service trips, deadheads, breaks, and more.

- **event.py**: Contains the representation of an event.
- **deadhead.py**: Contains the representation of an idle trip event.
- **service_trip.py**: Contains the representation of a service trip event.
- **travel.py**: Contains the representation of a travel event.

### 4. Event Container
This module allows for the grouping of multiple events.

- **event_container.py**: Contains the representation of an event container.
- **duty.py**: Contains the representation of a duty, representing the driver's work shift, including driving, breaks, and other tasks.
- **vehicle.py**: Contains the representation of a vehicle, representing a bus or any other transportation vehicle with multiple events.

### 5. Schedule
The schedule is the main module that brings everything together. It represents the overall schedule, including duties, vehicles, break rules, and duty-type rules.

- **schedule.py**: Contains the representation of a schedule.

## Getting Started
To utilize this scheduling system, ensure you have all the required modules and dependencies. Import the necessary classes from the modules and create instances as needed.

\```python
from schedule import Schedule
from event import Event
from event_container import Vehicle, Duty
from duty_type import DutyType
from break_rule import BreakRule, ContinuousBreakRule, FixedBreakRule
from abc import ABC
from typing import List
import unittest

# ... other necessary imports
\```

Then, instantiate and manipulate these objects to create your desired schedule.
